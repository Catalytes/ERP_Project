# ADR 0004: Terms and Conditions Finalization

## Status
Proposed (Pending Final Approval)

## Date
2026-01-21

## Context
Following the selection of the **License + Pitch** approach, the team identified the need to formally define Terms and Conditions governing collaboration with the college.

These Terms and Conditions are required to:
- Protect intellectual ownership of the ERP project
- Define usage and deployment boundaries
- Control disclosure of technical and architectural details
- Establish accountability between the project team and the institution

At the time of this record, the Terms and Conditions have been discussed conceptually but not finalized.

## Decision (Pending)
The team agreed that **formal Terms and Conditions will be created and finalized** before:

- Sharing detailed backend architecture
- Providing database schemas or API contracts
- Allowing institutional deployment or modification

Final approval of this decision is scheduled for the next working session.

## Planned Scope of Terms and Conditions
The finalized document is expected to address:
- Ownership of ideas, architecture, and implementation
- Usage rights granted to the college
- Restrictions on redistribution and replication
- Modification and extension rules
- Attribution and acknowledgment requirements

## Consequences
### Expected Positive Outcomes
- Legal clarity before collaboration deepens
- Reduced risk of idea misuse
- Clear professional boundaries with the institution

### Risks if Delayed
- Collaboration progress may slow
- Technical work disclosure remains restricted

## Next Steps
- Discuss detailed clauses
- Review legal and academic implications
- Finalize and obtain written acknowledgment

🗓️ **Planned Finalization Date:** 2026-01-22

## Notes
- Until this decision is finalized, all sensitive technical documentation remains restricted.
- This record will be **updated to “Accepted”** once Terms and Conditions are finalized and approved.
