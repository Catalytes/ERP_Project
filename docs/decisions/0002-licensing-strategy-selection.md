# ADR 0002: Licensing Strategy Selection

## Status
Accepted (Details Pending Finalization)

## Date
2026-01-21

## Context
Before formally pitching the ERP project to the college, the team identified the need for a legal mechanism to safeguard:

- Intellectual ownership of the ERP idea
- Architectural and design decisions
- Control over usage, modification, and redistribution

Given the academic environment and collaborative nature of the project, a full patent-first approach was considered heavy, while an open-source-first approach posed ownership risks.

## Options Considered
1. No explicit license (implicit trust)
2. Patent-first legal protection
3. Open-source license from the start
4. Custom license-based collaboration framework

## Decision
The team decided to proceed with a **license-based collaboration strategy**.

Key points of the selected strategy:
- A formal license will govern the sharing of the ERP idea.
- The license will define ownership, usage scope, and disclosure limits.
- The college must agree to the license terms **in writing** before receiving detailed technical information.
- The license will act as a prerequisite to deeper collaboration.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Provides legal clarity and protection
- Prevents unauthorized reuse or deployment
- Establishes professional boundaries early
- Aligns with academic and institutional collaboration norms

### Negative / Trade-offs
- License drafting requires additional time
- Final collaboration depends on institutional agreement

## Open Points
- The exact license type and clauses are **not finalized**.
- Terms & Conditions are scheduled to be:
  - Discussed
  - Reviewed
  - Finalized on **2026-01-22**

## Notes
- No backend schemas or implementation details will be disclosed until licensing terms are finalized.
- This decision works in conjunction with ADR 0001 but is scoped specifically to legal strategy.
