# ADR 0001: Project Approach and Pitch Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-01-21

## Context
The Catalytes team needed to decide how to approach the college authorities to pitch the ERP project.

Previous experiences raised concerns about:
- Idea reuse without consent
- Lack of written guarantees
- Loss of ownership over architectural and conceptual work

The team required an approach that allows collaboration with the college while safeguarding intellectual ownership and controlling technical disclosure.

## Options Considered
1. Direct pitch without safeguards  
2. Patent-first approach  
3. Open-source-first approach  
4. License + Pitch approach  

## Decision
The team decided to adopt the **License + Pitch** approach.

Under this approach:
- The ERP idea will be pitched to the college.
- Detailed technical architecture and implementation details will **not** be disclosed initially.
- The pitch will be conducted under a formal licensing framework.
- Written acknowledgment and agreement from the college will be required before deeper collaboration.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Protects intellectual ownership of the project
- Establishes formal boundaries before technical disclosure
- Enables structured and professional collaboration
- Reduces risk of unauthorized implementation

### Negative / Trade-offs
- Slightly slower onboarding due to legal discussions
- Requires additional documentation and coordination

## Notes
- This decision does **not** finalize the Terms & Conditions.
- Detailed Terms & Conditions are scheduled to be discussed and finalized separately.
- Until legal finalization, sensitive backend and architectural details remain restricted.
